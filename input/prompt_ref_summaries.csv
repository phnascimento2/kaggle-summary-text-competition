39c16e,"Aristotle, in Chapter 13 of his ""Poetics,"" outlines three key elements of an ideal tragedy:

    Complex Plot: Aristotle suggests that a perfect tragedy should be constructed on a complex plot rather than a simple one. This means that the storyline should involve various twists and turns, creating a multi-layered narrative that engages the audience's intellect and emotions.

    Pity and Fear: Aristotle identifies that the primary purpose of a tragedy is to evoke emotions, specifically pity and fear, in the audience. The actions depicted in the tragedy should lead to these emotional responses, as they are the distinctive markers of tragic imitation. The audience should feel both sympathy for the characters' suffering (pity) and apprehension about the consequences of their actions (fear).

    Character with a Flaw: Aristotle emphasizes that the central character of a tragedy should not be a virtuous individual brought from prosperity to adversity, nor a villain experiencing a shift from adversity to prosperity or their downfall. Instead, the protagonist should be a character who is not exceptionally virtuous but not wholly depraved either. Their misfortune should result from an error in judgment or some inherent frailty rather than outright vice. This character should be someone renowned and prosperous, making their fall from grace all the more tragic. Classic examples include Oedipus, Thyestes, and similar illustrious figures from famous families."
3b9047,"The ancient Egyptian system of government was structured like a pyramid, with different social classes playing distinct roles:

    Gods and Pharaohs: At the top were the gods, who were believed to control the universe, and the pharaohs, who were considered gods in human form. Pharaohs had absolute power and were responsible for protection, making laws, and collecting taxes in the form of grains.

    Vizier and Scribes: The pharaoh appointed a vizier as a chief minister to supervise various administrative tasks, including tax collection. Skilled scribes played a crucial role in keeping government records.

    Nobles and Priests: Just below the pharaoh in status were powerful nobles and priests. Nobles held government positions and profited from tributes paid to the pharaoh, while priests were responsible for pleasing the gods and enjoyed high status.

    Soldiers: Soldiers served in wars, maintained domestic peace, and supervised workers during periods of peace, overseeing construction projects.

    Skilled Workers and Merchants: The middle class included skilled workers such as physicians and craftsmen/women who produced and sold various goods. Merchants and storekeepers were responsible for selling these goods to the public.

    Slaves and Farmers: At the bottom of the social structure were slaves and farmers. Slaves were often prisoners of war and performed various tasks at the discretion of the pharaoh or nobles. Farmers worked the fields, paid taxes, and contributed to building projects.

Social mobility was possible, as some individuals moved up the economic ladder through education and employment opportunities. Peasants and farmers, for instance, could send their sons to village schools to learn trades, potentially leading to careers as scribes or government officials."
814d6b,"The Third Wave experiment, conducted by history teacher Ron Jones at Cubberley High School in 1967, aimed to demonstrate how people follow the crowd even in disturbing situations. Jones created a fictitious movement called ""The Third Wave"" to eliminate democracy, emphasizing discipline, community, action, and pride over individuality. He started with simple rules and enforced strict discipline, resulting in improved class efficiency.

The experiment unexpectedly gained momentum, expanding to 43 students and over 200 participants within days. Students showed academic improvement and loyalty to the movement. However, by the fourth day, Jones realized it was spiraling out of control and decided to end it. He deceived the students by announcing a nationwide movement and promised a presidential candidate's televised announcement.

At the end of the week, instead of a leader's address, students were met with a blank channel. Jones revealed the experiment's true purpose: to illustrate how people create superiority and justify cruel actions in the name of honor. The Third Wave experiment abruptly concluded to prevent further escalation."
ebad26,"The factory in ""The Jungle"" used various methods to handle and conceal spoiled meat:

    Canning or Sausage: When meat was spoiled and couldn't be used for anything else, they would either can it or chop it up into sausage. This allowed them to make use of even the spoiled meat.

    Use of Soda: Meat taken out of pickle that had gone sour would be rubbed up with soda to remove the smell and then sold on free-lunch counters.

    Chemical Manipulation: The factory employed chemical processes to give spoiled meat any desired color, flavor, or odor. This allowed them to disguise the poor quality of the meat.

    Second Pickle: For hams that were spoiled with a bad odor, they had a second, stronger pickle to eliminate the smell, a process known as ""giving them thirty per cent.""

    Re-labeling: They re-labeled meat that had gone bad after smoking and inserted a white-hot iron into the bad part. This practice eliminated the need for different meat grades, and all became ""Number One Grade.""

    Utilization of Scraps: They used all odds and ends of pork, even the least desirable parts, to create products like ""boneless hams,"" ""California hams,"" and ""head cheese.""

    Reusing Rejected Sausage: Old sausage from Europe that had been rejected and was moldy and white would be treated with borax and glycerin and reused for local consumption.

    Poor Hygiene: Meat would fall on the dirty floor and be trampled on, exposed to germs. Leaky roofs would drip water over stored meat, attracting rats.

    Rats in Meat: Workers would not remove rats found in the meat. Rats, bread, and meat would all end up in the hoppers together.

    Hand Washing in Contaminated Water: There was no place for workers to wash their hands before eating, so they would wash them in water used for sausage production.

    Using Waste: Scraps of meat, rusty nails, stale water, and other waste materials were dumped into barrels, sometimes preserved with borax and gelatin to make ""smoked"" sausage.

    Mislabeling and Charging More: Despite using the same bowl for all sausage, they would label some as ""special"" and charge higher prices for it.

These practices highlight the unscrupulous and unsanitary methods used by the meatpacking industry to maximize profits at the expense of consumer health and safety."
